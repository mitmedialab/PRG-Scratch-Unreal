Raw AWS SDK scripts for controlling access to EC2 instances; including describing, creating, starting, stopping or termina$

Place the .aws directory in your home directory for now. It uses the credentials of user 'XR-Script' for now.

startAll_G4_Instances and startSingle_G4_Instance are currently working and will be rolled into the Scratch script instead of bing standalone.

ec2_describeinstances will give you useful information about all instances in the region.
