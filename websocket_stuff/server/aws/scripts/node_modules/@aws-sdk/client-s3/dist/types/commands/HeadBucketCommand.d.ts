/**
 * <p>This action is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have permission to
 *          access it. The action returns a <code>200 OK</code> if the bucket exists and you have
 *          permission to access it.</p>
 *
 *
 *          <p>If the bucket does not exist or you do not have permission to access it, the <code>HEAD</code> request
 *          returns a generic <code>404 Not Found</code> or <code>403 Forbidden</code> code. A message body is not
 *          included, so you cannot determine the exception beyond these error codes.</p>
 *
 *          <p>To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
 *             <code>s3:ListBucket</code> action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and
 *          can grant this permission to others.
