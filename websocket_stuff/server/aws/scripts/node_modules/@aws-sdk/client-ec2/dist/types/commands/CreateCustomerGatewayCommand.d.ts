/**
 * <p>Provides information to AWS about your VPN customer gateway device. The customer
 *             gateway is the appliance at your end of the VPN connection. (The device on the AWS side
 *             of the VPN connection is the virtual private gateway.) You must provide the
 *             internet-routable IP address of the customer gateway's external interface. The IP
 *             address must be static and can be behind a device performing network address translation
 *             (NAT).</p>
 *         <p>For devices that use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), you can also provide the device's
 *             BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN). You can use an existing ASN assigned to your
 *             network. If you don't have an ASN already, you can use a private ASN (in the 64512 -
 *             65534 range).</p>
 *         <note>
 *             <p>Amazon EC2 supports all 4-byte ASN numbers in the range of 1 - 2147483647, with the
 *                 exception of the following:</p>
 *                 <ul>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>7224 - reserved in the <code>us-east-1</code> Region</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>9059 - reserved in the <code>eu-west-1</code> Region</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>17943 - reserved in the <code>ap-southeast-1</code> Region</p>
 *                </li>
 *                <li>
 *                   <p>10124 - reserved in the <code>ap-northeast-1</code> Region</p>

 *                 return information about the existing customer gateway and do not create new
