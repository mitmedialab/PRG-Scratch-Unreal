/**
 * <p>When you no longer want to use an On-Demand Dedicated Host it can be released.
 *             On-Demand billing is stopped and the host goes into <code>released</code> state. The
 *             host ID of Dedicated Hosts that have been released can no longer be specified in another
 *             request, for example, to modify the host. You must stop or terminate all instances on a
 *             host before it can be released.</p>
 *         <p>When Dedicated Hosts are released, it may take some time for them to stop counting
 *             toward your limit and you may receive capacity errors when trying to allocate new
 *             Dedicated Hosts. Wait a few minutes and then try again.</p>
