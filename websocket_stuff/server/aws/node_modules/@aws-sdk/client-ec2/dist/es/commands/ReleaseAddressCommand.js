/**
 * <p>Releases the specified Elastic IP address.</p>
 *          <p>[EC2-Classic, default VPC] Releasing an Elastic IP address automatically disassociates it
 * 				from any instance that it's associated with. To disassociate an Elastic IP address without
 * 				releasing it, use <a>DisassociateAddress</a>.</p>
 *          <p>[Nondefault VPC] You must use <a>DisassociateAddress</a> to disassociate the Elastic IP address
 * 			  before you can release it. Otherwise, Amazon EC2 returns an error (<code>InvalidIPAddress.InUse</code>).</p>
 *          <p>After releasing an Elastic IP address, it is released to the IP address pool.
 *         Be sure to update your DNS records and any servers or devices that communicate with the address.
 *         If you attempt to release an Elastic IP address that you already released, you'll get an
 *         <code>AuthFailure</code> error if the address is already allocated to another AWS account.</p>
 *          <p>[EC2-VPC] After you release an Elastic IP address for use in a VPC, you might be able to recover it.
 *         For more information, see <a>AllocateAddress</a>.</p>
