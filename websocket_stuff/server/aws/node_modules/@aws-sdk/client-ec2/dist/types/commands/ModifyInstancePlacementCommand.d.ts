 * <p>Modifies the placement attributes for a specified instance. You can do the

 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>Modify the affinity between an instance and a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-hosts-overview.html">Dedicated
 *                         Host</a>. When affinity is set to <code>host</code> and the instance is
 *                     not associated with a specific Dedicated Host, the next time the instance is
 *                     launched, it is automatically associated with the host on which it lands. If the
 *                     instance is restarted or rebooted, this relationship persists.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>Change the Dedicated Host with which an instance is associated.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>Change the instance tenancy of an instance from <code>host</code> to
 *                         <code>dedicated</code>, or from <code>dedicated</code> to
 *                     <code>host</code>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>Move an instance to or from a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html">placement
 *                     group</a>.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *         <p>At least one attribute for affinity, host ID, tenancy, or placement group name must
 *             be specified in the request. Affinity and tenancy can be modified in the same
 *             request.</p>
 *         <p>To modify the host ID, tenancy, placement group, or partition for an instance, the
 *             instance must be in the <code>stopped</code> state.</p>
