# Local Server Tests

This folder contains old tests that were ran in order to test certain functionality. Most of these do not matter too much anymore but are still stored just in case they need to be referrenced in the future. 

Some of these files were used to set up a local server in order to test websocket data transfer. The files in `websocket_stuff` do the same operations but in more depth.
